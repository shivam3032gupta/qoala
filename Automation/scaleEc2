# Process to scale ec2 on cpu utlization

We can implement the application service in ASG in aws . 
then ASG provides you the functionality to scale up or scale down the instances based on a cloud watch alarm that you create for cpu utilization

Let suppose you create a cpu utilization alarm in cloudwatch:\
threshold: 50%
period: 5 minutes
datapoints: 3

then if 3 consecutive data points are encountered in which cpu utilization was greater then 50% for 5 minutes the alarm will trigger, Cloud watch alarm can be used then  to scale the asg if alarm is in active state.

You can add scaling policies in asg to increase n number of instances if alarm gets trigerred .
